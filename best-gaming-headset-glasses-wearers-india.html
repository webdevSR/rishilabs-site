            <p class="intro">The familiar ache behind your ears. The annoying pressure on the side of your head. For gamers who wear glasses, finding a comfortable headset can feel like an impossible mission. You're forced to choose between clear vision and clear audio, and the compromise is always uncomfortable.</p>
            <p>But it doesn't have to be that way.</p>
            <p>Here at Rishi Labs, we understand that comfort is key for long gaming sessions. We've dived deep into the world of gaming audio to find the headsets that don't just tolerate your glasses—they embrace them. This guide will break down exactly what to look for and give you our top recommendations available in India right now. No fluff, just honest insights.</p>

            <h2>What Makes a Headset "Glasses-Friendly"? The 4 Key Factors</h2>
            <p>Before we get to the products, it's important to understand <em>why</em> some headsets feel great with glasses and others feel like a medieval torture device. It comes down to four key design elements.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Earcup Design & Material</h3>
            <p>This is the most critical factor. You want deep, plush, over-ear earcups. Memory foam is your best friend, as it molds around the arms of your glasses, creating a good seal without excessive pressure. Breathable fabric earcups are often more forgiving than stiff leatherette.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Clamping Force</h3>
            <p>This is the "squeeze" the headset puts on your head. A headset with a high clamping force will be a nightmare for glasses wearers. We look for headsets with a light-to-medium, flexible clamping force that holds the headset securely without crushing your frames.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Frame Material</h3>
            <p>A headband made of flexible steel or durable aluminum is often better than one made of rigid plastic. A flexible frame allows the headset to contour to your head shape more naturally, accommodating the extra space taken up by your glasses.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Weight</h3>
            <p>It's simple physics: the lighter the headset, the less pressure it will exert on your head over time. A lightweight design is essential for marathon gaming sessions, preventing both head and ear fatigue.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) & Final Verdict</h2>

            <h3>Do over-ear or on-ear headsets work better with glasses?</h3>
            <p>Over-ear headsets are almost always better. They are designed to completely enclose your ear, allowing the cushion to rest on your head around the ear, rather than pressing your ear and glasses arm together.</p>

            <h3>How can I make my current headset more comfortable with glasses?</h3>
            <p>If you're not ready to upgrade, try finding softer, deeper replacement earcups for your current model. Sometimes a "gel-infused" or "cooling gel" memory foam earcup can make a world of difference.</p>

            <h3>Our Final Recommendation</h3>
            <p>For most people, the <strong>HyperX Cloud Alpha</strong> remains the king of comfort, especially for glasses wearers. It’s a fantastic investment that will last for years. If you're on a tighter budget, the <strong>Razer BlackShark V2 X</strong> offers incredible comfort and performance for its price and is an excellent choice.</p>
